      <description>I went to a talk at Bristech on the subject of autoML in Azure. I have to say I was pretty convinced the autoML is the future. Azure’s autoML is built on sklearn (and therefore it’s a python-only SDK), so I did a big of googling and it turns out the autoML with sklearn is actually open-source. You just need to install the ‘auto’sklearn’ package onto your computer and you’re good to go.</description>
