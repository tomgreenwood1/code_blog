      <description>I have been wanting to learn Rust for some time, but one of the things thatâ€™s been on my mind is: If I learn some good Rust, how am I going to blog about it? This site is build on blogdown, which is R markdown + Hugo, so any code is blog posts needs to be run by knitr (which is the package with runs lots of different languages and outputs the result in rmarkdown).</description>
