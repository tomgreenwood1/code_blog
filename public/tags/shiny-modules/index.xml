      <description>I’ve been wanting to learn about shiny modules ever since my shiny-building Italian colleague, Dan, pointed out that they might be a good way to keep the code more organised for bigger apps. My first try was overly ambitious and ended in an untagleable mess of modules within modules that didn’t run, so I decided to go with something nice and simple first off, and build from there. In fact, I’d say that’s a principle I’m sticking with from now on when it comes to building apps: start with something simple and add complexity.</description>
