      <description>This is the person programming blog of Tom Greenwood (who after this introductory paragraph will henceforth refer to himself in the first person). Most probably, these posts will read as a series of attempts to run before learning to walk. I will enable commenting as soon as I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt how..
It is built using the blogdown package. The theme was forked from @jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yihui Xie and then actually modified a little bit more, by me.</description>
