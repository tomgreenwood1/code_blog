This is the person programming blog of Tom Greenwood (who after this introductory paragraph will henceforth refer to himself in the first person). Most probably, these posts will read as a series of attempts to run before learning to walk. I will enable commenting as soon as I've learnt how.. 

It is built using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium) and then actually modified a little bit more, by me.
